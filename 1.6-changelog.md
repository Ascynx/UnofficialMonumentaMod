That overlay shows the custom effects in your tab list.

<summary>Chest Count Overlay</summary>

<p>
This overlay shows the current count of chests opened while being in a strike shard,

<summary>Texture Spoofing</summary>

<p>
Allows the player to trick the game into thinking an item is another item, allowing it to render another texture.
To make it work, I recommend just reading the [wiki page]https://github.com/Ascynx/UnofficialMonumentaMod/wiki/Texture-spoofing
