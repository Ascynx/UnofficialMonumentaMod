This is an unofficial client-side mod for the Monumenta MMO server (www.playmonumenta.com).

## Feature List

### Firmament ping fix

Makes the "Firmament" item usable even at high ping (and may also be an improvement even with low ping).

### Trident texture fix

Shows custom trident textures of the resource pack when tridents are held instead of only when in the inventory.

**Important: The resource pack "Fabric Mods" needs to be above the Monumenta resource pack!** Otherwise, tridents will
be tiny when held.

The thrown trident projectiles still look like the vanilla trident, as changing that would require a server-side mod.
